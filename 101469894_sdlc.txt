###About SDLC
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying software systems. The main phases include:


1. Planning: Initial phase where requirements are gathered and analyzed

2. Design: System architecture and technical specifications are created

3. Implementation: Actual coding and development of the software

4. Testing: Verification and validation of the software

5. Deployment: Release of the software to users

6. Maintenance: Ongoing support and updates


Common SDLC models include:

- Waterfall: Sequential approach

- Agile: Iterative and flexible approach

- Spiral: Risk-driven approach

- V-Model: Verification and validation model


Benefits of SDLC:

- Structured approach to development

- Clear objectives and expectations

- Better resource management

- Quality control and risk management

- Systematic testing and documentation
